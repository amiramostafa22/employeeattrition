# IBM Predicting Employee Attrition and Performance

This research investigates the relationship between employee attrition and performance within the context of IBM HR Analytics, utilizing a supervised machine learning approach. The methodology involves comprehensive data processing steps, including data import, retrieval, exploratory data analysis, pre-processing and data modeling. The dataset, with 1500 rows and 35 columns, encompasses various employee-related factors. Multiple machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, XGBoost, CatBoost, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest and Na√Øve Bayes, are employed to predict employee attrition. The Champion Model identified as Logistic Regression with accuracy
87%. The study also delves into the relationships between job satisfaction, business travel, monthly income, and attrition based on various demographic factors.
